## Development Notes: Baby Shower Website

The purpose of this baby shower website is to create a central, beautifully designed space where friends and family can easily find all the important event details. It allows guests to RSVP quickly, view the wishlist, and feel welcomed with a personalized design that reflects the couple’s personality. This site makes planning and attending the baby shower simpler, more organized, and more enjoyable for everyone involved.

## Features & Fixes

### Navigation Auto-Close on Click
Used JavaScript to close the mobile nav menu when a link is clicked. This improves the mobile experience and avoids confusion.

### Sticky Header
Made the navigation stay at the top while scrolling so visitors can access any section at any time.

### Hover Effects
Customized button hover styles for a more polished interactive feel.

### QR Code Instructions
Added clear 3-line instructions to help users scan the QR code and access the wishlist quickly.

### Simple Section Organization
Each section was kept focused and minimal to reduce overwhelm and allow the couple’s personality to shine through.
